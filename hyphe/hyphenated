The body­work, the lines of union are touched, the uphol­stery pal­pat­ed, the seats tried, the doors caressed, the cush­ions fon­dled; before the wheel, one pre­tends to drive with one’s whole body. The object here is totally pros­ti­tut­ed, appro­pri­at­ed: orig­i­nat­ing from the heaven of<i>Metrop­o­lis</i>, the God­dess is in a quar­ter of an hour medi­a­tized, actu­al­iz­ing through this exor­cism the very essence of petit-bour­geois advance­ment.<span><br></span>—Roland Barthes, “Citroën DS” in<i>Mytholo­gies</i>(1957)</p></blockquote><p>The French psy­cho­an­a­lyst Jacques Lacan drove a Cit­roën DS. What else? This car, Barthes tells us, was a truly mag­i­cal object, a per­fect fetish, the essence of free­dom, move­ment, and pow­er. And yet, cars are also a sign of our insignif­i­cance, like the prob­lem of traf­fic jams, park­ing lots, and sta­tis­ti­cal casu­al­ties. The DS—or<i>Déesse</i>(a word­play on the ini­tials that jus­ti­fied Barthes’s call­ing the car his God­dess)—seemed to promise the abil­ity to drive with one’s whole body—the bro­ken promise of all tech­nol­o­gy. We can almost touch the future. Almost.</p><p>Lacan under­stood the seduc­tive appeal. Read any­thing about Lacan’s life and you will find it punc­tu­ated by sto­ries about cars and dri­ving. These are cer­tainly apoc­ryphal sto­ries told about him that have cir­cu­lated among psy­cho­an­a­lysts and appear in biogra­phies or anec­do­tal com­men­tary, but cars were also clearly a thor­ough-­go­ing tex­ture in his thought. Almost every case study Lacan men­tion­s—and these are quite rare in the twen­ty-eight years of sem­i­nars that form the spine of his work—­some­how or other ends up involv­ing a car, dri­ving, and road­ways.<span></span></p><p>Of course, we Eng­lish speak­ers hear another pun in dri­ve: “drive” as a verb, some­thing we do, and “drive” as a noun, some­thing that acts upon us. Even if the equiv­a­lence does­n’t exactly work out in French—<i>con­duire, pul­sion</i>—La­can nev­er­the­less fought against the Eng­lish trans­la­tion of Freud’s<i>Trieb</i>into “in­stinc­t”—­drive, he said, is the only trans­la­tion to mil­i­tate against such stu­pid Amer­i­can Dar­win­ism. But it isn’t the pun that inter­ests me so much as the fact that this car busi­ness makes Lacan seem a lit­tle more pedes­tri­an, while still allow­ing for a mythol­o­gy, slightly off-­cen­ter, away from the great man. After all, isn’t this just a boy and his toy?<span></span></p><p>Not for Lacan, who placed the car at the very cen­ter of his own analy­sis. Lacan was in a six-year psy­cho­analy­sis with Rudolph Löwen­stein, who had him­self been ana­lyzed by Freud, and later emi­grated to New York. It was not a fruit­ful encoun­ter, with Lacan attempt­ing to take the dri­ving seat:<span></span></p><blockquote><p>To illus­trate the sit­u­a­tion between him and Löwen­stein, Lacan told Cather­ine Mil­lot of an inci­dent that occurred at the time. One day he was dri­ving his lit­tle car through a tun­nel when a truck came at him head­-on from the oppo­site direc­tion. He decided to keep going, and the truck gave way. He told Löwen­stein what had hap­pened, hop­ing to make him see the truth of their trans­fer­en­tial rela­tion­ship. But he got no answer. And the mor­tal strug­gle… ended in open con­flict.<span></span></p></blockquote><p>Lacan was only granted mem­ber­ship to the Psy­cho­an­a­lytic Soci­ety of Paris in 1938 as a bar­gain­ing chip to admit another psy­cho­an­a­lyst flee­ing Ger­many, Heinz Hart­mann, who was a friend of Löwen­stein’s. Since this was against the advice of his ana­lyst, who felt Lacan needed more work, the insti­tute decided to make Lacan’s mem­ber­ship con­di­tional upon con­tin­u­ing in his analy­sis. Instead, he promptly left it. We now have a num­ber of bit­ter let­ters in which we see Löwen­stein openly denounc­ing Lacan—a ter­ri­ble breach of con­fi­den­tial­i­ty, no less of ethics. Strange fact: when Lacan was even­tu­ally thrown out of the Inter­na­tional Psy­cho­an­a­lyt­i­cal Asso­ci­a­tion for his use of vari­able length ses­sions (and not the stan­dard forty-­five to fifty min­utes), Lacan declared the ana­lyst pre­sid­ing over the com­mis­sion to be his mor­tal ene­my. This ana­lyst was later killed in a car crash.<span></span></p><p>Lacan had two fam­i­lies, and his two youngest daugh­ters were born, to their dif­fer­ent moth­ers, just eight months apart. Even after he left his first wife, Malou Blondin-La­can, their three chil­dren did not know of his other wife, Sylvia Bataille, and their daugh­ter, Judith, for quite some time. There was, how­ev­er, a fate­ful encounter at a cross­walk. Lacan’s son and youngest daugh­ter rec­og­nized their father in his car, but not the woman next to him, nor the lit­tle girl sit­ting in the back seat. When they called out and ran toward him, he drove off. Only sub­se­quently would they put two and two togeth­er. When, lat­er, Lacan’s eldest daugh­ter, Car­o­line, was killed by a drunk dri­ver, her funeral was one of the few occa­sions that the fam­i­lies were forced to con­front one anoth­er’s exis­tence.<span></span></p><p>Lacan’s son-in-law, Jacques-Alain Miller, wrote a bio­graph­i­cal text on Lacan and speaks about his intol­er­ance of red lights, how he ran them all the time. Even when Lacan was merely a pas­sen­ger, if you refused to run a red light, he would get out of the car, walk through the cross­ing, and have you pick him up on the other side. Appar­ent­ly, this behav­ior was a source of great anx­i­ety for his daugh­ter, who had to devise ways to avoid stop­ping when dri­ving.<span></span></p><p>Lacan him­self drove fast. Once, he took Mar­tin Hei­deg­ger and his wife, Elfride, on a day trip to Chartres to visit the cathe­dral. Though Hei­deg­ger was a hero of his, Lacan con­tin­ued to drive at his char­ac­ter­is­tic high speed despite Elfride’s fran­tic protes­ta­tions. As the story goes, Lacan was com­pletely silent on the long drive back as he pressed harder and harder on the gas ped­al.<span></span></p><p>Cather­ine Mil­lot, Lacan’s patient and lover, in her auto­bi­o­graph­i­cal book,<i>Life with Lacan</i>, wrote of how he used to dri­ve:<span></span></p><blockquote><p>[H]is head for­ward, grip­ping the steer­ing wheel, treat­ing obsta­cles with con­tempt, as one of my women friends not­ed, never slow­ing down even for a red light—and as for observ­ing the right of way… well, let’s not go there. The first time, on the autoroute, trav­el­ling at some 120m­ph, I had a fit of the gig­gles which I sup­pressed only with dif­fi­cul­ty. But even if I’d burst out laugh­ing, he’d never have noticed; he was con­cen­trat­ing too hard… there was no point in implor­ing him to slow down. Once, his step­daugh­ter Lau­rence had come up with a bright idea: she asked him to drive more slowly so that she could “look at the coun­try­side.” He told her: “Just pay more atten­tion.”</p></blockquote><p>Mil­lot and Miller both con­sider Lacan’s way of dri­ving as part of his eth­i­cal stance. One had to fol­low one’s desire and not give way to inhi­bi­tions or norms. If one had to stop, make it a choice; do not yield to an anony­mous law or the whims of the oth­er’s demand. His dri­ving ethic is even used to explain his rapa­cious con­sump­tion of lux­ury good­s—La­can had quite an art col­lec­tion, and was known for his sar­to­r­ial extrav­a­gance, from cus­tom-­made suits in unusual tex­tiles, to furs, and shoes in rare skins. It may even explain why “ob­sti­nate” is the last word attrib­uted to Lacan before his death. This is always the story that one encoun­ters about Lacan, part of the mythol­ogy of the coura­geous, dis­obe­di­ent, relent­less man.<span></span></p><p>*</p><figure data-id="67283"><img src="https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-111074999.jpg" alt width="1600" height="1124" srcset="https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-111074999.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-111074999-125x88.jpg 125w, https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-111074999-768x540.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"><figcaption><small>Gam­ma-Rapho via Getty Images</small>The Cit­roën DS 19, France, 1955</figcaption></figure><p>If one looks at how Lacan speaks about cars through­out his work, it is not just this mytho­log­i­cal tale of man v. law, but some­thing more, and more extra­or­di­nary: a real love affair with the car, a pas­sion of the strangest of con­tours. If Freud had a fas­ci­nat­ing and symp­to­matic rela­tion to train­s—the place that he first encoun­tered his mother naked and thus the scene of a cer­tain trans­gres­sive, inces­tu­ous excite­ment; the con­veyance on which he found he felt guilty for sur­pass­ing his father in the scope of his trav­els; and for which he devel­oped some­thing of a pho­bia, only par­tially resolved by his self­-­analy­sis—­for Lacan, it was cer­tainly cars. Lacan joked that while a psy­cho­an­a­lytic insti­tute, think­ing of itself as a kind of dri­ving school, might offer one a dri­ver’s license, we should­n’t mis­take this for know­ing how to fix a car or “su­per­vise” car con­struc­tion. Psy­cho­an­a­lysts might be a kind of dri­ving instruc­tor but they should not mis­take them­selves for auto-me­chan­ics.<span></span></p><p>The first ref­er­ence to cars in Lacan’s teach­ing appears in his sec­ond sem­i­nar, given in 1954–1955. In a super­vi­sion group, a patient was dis­cussed who had dreamed of a help­less baby, like a tur­tle on its back. Lacan said to the psy­cho­an­a­lyst, “The child is the sub­ject. There is no doubt about it.” The patient went on to have another dream: of swim­ming in a sea with spe­cial char­ac­ter­is­tics that also made it the ana­lyst’s couch, the ana­lyst’s car cush­ions, and, of course, the mother (<i>mère</i>,<i>mer</i>). While the asso­ci­a­tion of the tra­di­tional psy­cho­an­a­lytic set­ting (ly­ing on a couch, with the ana­lyst seated behind) with being dri­ven around in a car by one’s par­ents is quite com­mon, the dream, Lacan says, isn’t really about the depen­dency of chil­dren. Rather, it is about the rep­e­ti­tion of a ques­tion we help­lessly ask through­out our lives: Am I a legit­i­mate child? “Aren’t I, after all, your child, you the ana­lyst?” To whom do I belong?<span></span></p><p>A car then reap­pears the fol­low­ing year in an impor­tant sem­i­nar eval­u­at­ing the ques­tion of psy­chosis in psy­cho­analy­sis. Lacan is try­ing to show how for­eign the world becomes for some­one hav­ing a psy­chotic break­down:<span></span></p><blockquote><p>If he encoun­ters a red car in the street—a car is not a nat­ural objec­t—it’s not for noth­ing, he will say, that it went past at that very moment. Let us inquire into this delu­sional intu­ition. The car has a mean­ing, but the sub­ject is very often inca­pable of say­ing what it is. Is it favor­able? Is it threat­en­ing? Surely there is some rea­son for the car’s being there.<span></span></p></blockquote><p>The red car becomes the par­a­dig­matic object of para­noia. Like the robin red­breast, it can become a malev­o­lent sign, mak­ing us, in effect, see red. In the face of ques­tions not eas­ily answered—why is this car there? Why am I here?—the need to find an answer tips in the direc­tion of aggres­sion.<span></span></p><p>In fact, in his ear­lier text “Ag­gres­sive­ness in Psy­cho­analy­sis,” writ­ten in 1948, the car is already linked to poten­tial feel­ings of hos­til­i­ty:<span></span></p><blockquote><p>These phan­tas­mago­rias crop up con­stantly in dreams, espe­cially when an analy­sis appears to reflect off the back­drop of the most archaic fix­a­tions. I will men­tion here a dream recounted by one of my patients, whose aggres­sive dri­ves man­i­fested them­selves in obses­sive fan­tasies. In the dream he saw him­self in a car, with the woman with whom he was hav­ing a rather dif­fi­cult love affair, being pur­sued by a fly­ing fish whose bal­loon-­like body was so trans­par­ent that one could see the hor­i­zon­tal level of liq­uid it con­tained: an image of vesi­cal per­se­cu­tion of great anatom­i­cal clar­i­ty.<span></span></p></blockquote><p>The man is try­ing to escape some­thing in his car and that object is the image of a uri­nary blad­der. Cars, the dream seems to say, are like human organs exter­nal­ized—this is the pros­thetic pur­pose of tech­nol­ogy and even weapon­ry, indeed the “body­work” of which Barthes spoke. Lacan imag­ines that the eter­nal strug­gle of humans with one another and with their bod­ies might find res­o­lu­tion in ser­vice to the machine, where “psy­chotech­nics” will give us no choice but to be “race-­car dri­vers and guards for reg­u­lat­ing power sta­tion­s.”<span></span></p><p>Lacan’s car theme then reaches a pitch of delir­i­um. He begins to imag­ine the human being in an Eden in reverse, a kind of hell of mechan­i­cal crea­tures with­out any form of reg­u­la­tion:</p><blockquote><p>Think of these lit­tle auto­mo­biles that you see at fairs going round at full tilt out in an open space, where the prin­ci­pal amuse­ment is to bump into the oth­ers. If these dodg’em cars give so much plea­sure, it is because bump­ing into one another must be some­thing fun­da­men­tal in the human being. What would hap­pen if a cer­tain num­ber of lit­tle machines like those I describe were put onto the track. Each one being uni­fied and reg­u­lated by the sight of anoth­er, it is not math­e­mat­i­cally impos­si­ble to imag­ine that we would end up with all the lit­tle machines accu­mu­lated in the cen­ter of the track, blocked in a con­glom­er­a­tion the size of which would only be lim­ited by the exter­nal resis­tance of the pan­el­work. A col­li­sion, every­thing smashed to a pulp.<span></span></p></blockquote><p>This isn’t just the traf­fic jam of all traf­fic jams, it is an image of humans bashed, bumped, and even­tu­ally ground to destruc­tion. Yet this dystopian image of infi­nite piled-up dodgem cars does not pre­vent Lacan from going on to fan­ta­size about the smooth, vast, effi­ciency of high­ways that he calls an “orig­i­nal real­i­ty,” a marked “stage of his­to­ry” com­pa­ra­ble to the build­ing of Roman roads, which left traces that are “prac­ti­cally irre­mov­able.” High­ways pro­vide order, cut through space, dis­trib­ute and sign­post life, con­nect us to one anoth­er. But what if there aren’t high­ways?<span></span></p><p>Lacan makes a wild leap: with­out them, he says, we might become com­pletely psy­chotic, forced to take any num­ber of small roads on which we will inevitably get lost: “where the sig­ni­fier isn’t func­tion­ing, it starts speak­ing on its own, at the edge of the high­way.” The street signs will start speak­ing to us—in other words, audi­tory hal­lu­ci­na­tions. Psy­chotic fan­tasies fol­low a trail of mean­ing pre­cisely because, for the suf­fer­er, mean­ing has fallen to pieces.<span></span></p><p>The end of this car and high­way story<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ChAfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA285&amp;lpg=PA285&amp;dq=thou+art+the+one+who+will+follow+me+jacques+lacan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XWwT6A-BrZ&amp;sig=ACfU3U1WPPTU4u4l2olIW8zc_t6w20-2-g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwinoLDmyIrkAhWFnFkKHaDYCf8Q6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=thou%20art%20the%20one%20who%20will%20follow%20me%20jacques%20lacan&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in this sem­i­nar</a>is quite beau­ti­ful, trac­ing the way the sen­tence “Thou art the one who will fol­low me” might be heard. It could be a per­se­cu­tory com­mand. But it could also be a gen­tle invi­ta­tion to the unknown. You ask the other to fol­low you; to be, in effect, a psy­cho­an­a­lyst—say any­thing, every­thing, and off we go. The per­son who wel­comes your words, Lacan says, is some­one you can really fall in love with. That can change your direc­tion. Get you out of the hor­rific pile-up of inter­per­sonal per­se­cu­tions. The psy­cho­an­a­lyst could save us from auto-de­struc­tion.<span></span></p><p>In a sem­i­nar titled<i>Desire and Its Inter­pre­ta­tion</i>, Lacan describes a case from the British psy­cho­an­a­lyst Ella Free­man Sharpe. It begins with an impor­tant dream that involves a cave with a kind of hood:<span></span></p><blockquote><p>My mind, he con­tin­ues, has gone to the hood again and I am remem­ber­ing the first car I was ever in. (But at that time of course it was not called a car but a motor, because the sub­ject is fairly old.) Well! The hood of this motor was one of its most obvi­ous fea­tures. It was strapped back when not in use. The inside of it was lined with scar­let. And he con­tin­ues: The peak of speed for that car was about six­ty. (He speaks about this car as if he were speak­ing about the life of a car, as if it were human.) I remem­ber I was sick in that car, and that reminds me of the time I had to uri­nate into a paper bag when I was in a rail­way train as a child. Still I think of the hood.<span></span></p></blockquote><p>Ella Free­man Sharpe is quick to inter­pret the patien­t’s stan­dard Oedi­pal fan­tasy (the car rep­re­sent­ing his desire for his moth­er, the cave with a hood is her vagi­na), fol­low­ing up with another of the patien­t’s asso­ci­a­tion­s—a fear of his car’s break­ing down and stop­ping the motor­cade of the King and Queen. Lacan, how­ev­er, jumps on this inter­pre­ta­tion as hasty and banal: “What on the con­trary seems to me to be very strik­ing, is pre­cisely the func­tion of the car… The sub­ject is in a car, and far from sep­a­rat­ing any­thing by this stop­ping… every­thing stops, he stops the oth­ers… in a sin­gle car which envelops them like the hood of his car.” The patient wants to stop all speech and to keep every­one else at<i>their</i>peak of speed, while he stays shel­tered in his car. Speech is expos­ing, speech makes the oth­ers less omnipo­tent, speech slows us down.<span></span></p><p>The patient finally comes in and tells Sharpe that he wanted his car this morn­ing, and even though he did­n’t need it, he became quite angry that the garage mechanic had not fin­ished fix­ing it. The ana­lyst greets this desire like the dove that flies to Noah’s ark, and Lacan says, he is in “com­plete” agree­ment with her:<span></span></p><blockquote><p>She under­stands the impor­tance of that, namely what is present in the life of a sub­ject as desire prop­erly speak­ing, desire being char­ac­ter­ized by its non-­mo­ti­vated char­ac­ter—he has no need of this car; the fact that he declares his desire to her, that it is the first time that she hears such a dis­course, is some­thing which presents itself as unrea­son­able in the dis­course of the sub­ject.<span></span></p></blockquote><p>The patient wants his car, he likes his car, he loves it, in fact. He speaks about it as if it were alive. The patien­t’s father had died of can­cer when he was quite young and Sharpe says that they had finally got­ten to a place where he imag­ined his father not only as alive, but as speak­ing. But what the father said was ter­ri­fy­ing: “Robert must take my place.” Lacan inter­prets this state­ment as a demand: be where I am, where I am dying. He neu­rot­i­cally com­plied—­par­a­lyzed, car-sick, bro­ken down. Want­ing the car, indeed want­ing it fixed in a hur­ry, this mirac­u­lous sign of desire, finally takes him past the mor­ti­fy­ing pater­nal com­mand­ment.<span></span></p><p>The most explicit moment when Lacan the­o­rized the car appears in his sem­i­nar on<i>Trans­fer­ence</i>in 1960–1961. He says, point blank, that one’s rela­tion to the car is the hinge between the ide­al-ego (the super-e­go, as moral demands and nar­cis­sis­tic images) and the ego-ideal (the sin­gu­lar traits of our par­ents’ desire that we can iden­tify with), and the ana­lyst must be decid­edly on the side of the lat­ter. If the ana­lyst takes up the super-ego posi­tion, it will be “an ideal ego in the same sense as one says that a car is an ideal car: it is not an ideal of the car, nor the dream of the car when it is all alone in the garage, it is a really good and solid car.” But there is no “re­ally good and solid car.” We are not here, as psy­cho­an­a­lysts, to com­ment on the car’s build as good, solid, nor­mal, or not. Bet­ter that we dream of the car. Or desire that the patient dream of the car.<span></span></p><p>Lacan was very invested in the dif­fer­ence between the ide­al-ego and the ego-ideal in Freud’s con­cep­tion of the ori­gin of the psy­che and the devel­op­ment of civ­i­liza­tion, espe­cially the prob­lem of what Freud called group or mass psy­chol­o­gy. The ego-ideal is full of wishes that are his­toric and speci­fic, while the super-ego represses these libid­i­nal ties and homog­e­nizes indi­vid­u­als into an imag­i­nary group iden­ti­ty—­like think­ing one­self to be a “re­ally good and solid” Chris­t­ian or Con­ser­v­a­tive or Brex­i­teer:<span></span></p><blockquote><p>The ideal ego is the son and heir at the wheel of his lit­tle sports’ car. And with that he is going to show you a bit of the coun­try­side. He is going to play the smart alec. He is going to indulge his taste for tak­ing risks, which is not a bad thing, his love of sport, as they say. And every­thing is going to con­sist in know­ing what mean­ing he gives to this word sport, whether sport can­not also be defy­ing the rules, I am not sim­ply say­ing the rules of the road, but also those of safe­ty. In any case, this indeed is the reg­is­ter in which he will have to show him­self as being bet­ter than the oth­ers, even if this con­sists in say­ing that they are going a bit far. That is what the ideal ego is.<span></span></p></blockquote><p>Fight­ing Daddy at the wheel of one’s “sports’ car” to prove who is the bet­ter man is dif­fer­ent from try­ing to obtain an object of love with a car, or lov­ing the car. This is the “side-­door” every­one is look­ing to get out of when it comes to the father (or, say, a dem­a­gogic lead­er). We seek an exit from our enmesh­ment with author­i­ty. Psy­cho­analy­sis wants to do so by sub­vert­ing this game of the ide­al-­car with the car-ide­al, the car as a vehi­cle for love and desire, not its repres­sion.<span></span></p><p>A lit­tle later in the same sem­i­nar, in an aside, Lacan dis­cusses a man he met (not in psy­cho­analy­sis) who opened up to him con­cern­ing mat­ters of the heart. He says this man was a an “ex­tremely rich man.” One day, he “knocked down some­body on the street with the bumper of his big car. Even though he always drove very care­ful­ly.” The woman he knocked over was very pret­ty; she received his apolo­gies, his attempts to pay dam­ages, and an offer of a date all rather cold­ly.<span></span></p><p>“In short, in the mea­sure that the dif­fi­culty became greater of gain­ing access to this mirac­u­lously encoun­tered object, the notion grew in his mind,” Lacan explained. “He told him­self that there was here a real asset. And it was for this very rea­son that all of this led him into mar­riage.” If love is sup­posed to go beyond nar­cis­sis­tic images of what’s valu­able, this is not the case for this man who accu­mu­lated “goods and mer­it­s.” This woman he met by mir­a­cle was an ide­al-­car, which is why, after mar­ry­ing her, acquir­ing her, he wanted to keep her in his safe along with all the jew­els that he bought for her. After some time, the woman ran off with a rather poor engi­neer.<span></span></p><p>In one of the rare, lengthy cases dis­cussed by Lacan in his sem­i­nar on<i>Anx­i­ety</i>of 1961–1962, there is, once again, a car. Lacan tells the story of a woman who was in analy­sis with him and finds her­self at a dis­tance from her hus­band, whom she liked to com­plain about for always being around:<span></span></p><blockquote><p>So here she is now, speak­ing about her state. She speaks about it, for a change, with pecu­liar pre­ci­sion, which brings out the fact that tumes­cence is not a man’s priv­i­lege. This wom­an, whose sex­u­al­ity is quite nor­mal, bears wit­ness to what occurs for her if, when she is dri­ving, for exam­ple, an alert flashes up for a mov­ing entity that makes her say to her­self some­thing along the lines of “God, a car!” Well, inex­plic­a­bly, she notices the exis­tence of a vagi­nal swelling.<span></span></p></blockquote><p>He claims that when a woman is close to this kind of orgas­mic plea­sure, she is closer to the world—“­more true and more real.” What she desires is what there is, even if it’s merely a car dri­ving by.<span></span></p><p>For this woman in analy­sis, he says, the car was about the mean­ing­ful­ness of the world-as-­such, rather than any par­tic­u­lar mean­ing, espe­cially one that is in dan­ger of adding to a fic­tion of the self, of tan­gling one up there. Also, the patient says, this is hap­pen­ing because she can come and tell her ana­lyst about it all. This is where she had come to in her work with Lacan: the car as a sig­nal, not of anx­i­ety, but of a desire that is prac­ti­cally emp­ty, but infinite, and so infi­nitely mobile.<span></span></p><p>*</p><figure data-id="67278"><img src="https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PAR339045.jpg" alt width="1600" height="1073" srcset="https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PAR339045.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PAR339045-125x84.jpg 125w, https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PAR339045-768x515.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"><figcaption><small>Bruno Bar­bey/­Mag­num Pho­tos</small>A car over­turned on Rue Gay Lus­sac after a night of riot­ing, Paris, France, May 11, 1968</figcaption></figure><p>The very last men­tion of cars in Lacan occurred dur­ing the events of May 1968. Lacan moved his sem­i­nar to Vin­cen­nes, where stu­dents had set-up an exper­i­men­tal uni­ver­si­ty. There is some dis­crep­ancy with respect to what he exactly said (all his sem­i­nars are tran­scribed from record­ings), whether exclaim­ing that he saw thir­ty-six cars, or thir­ty-six police cars, on his drive there. Either way, he implored the stu­dents not to mis­take the force of these cars—their dis­play of will—­for actual pow­er; though he admit­ted that they do give a robust illu­sion that some­one is in charge. From 1948 to 1968, we have come full cir­cle, the car finally invok­ing a dystopian image of the world.</p><p>Lacan tried to teach the stu­dents how psy­cho­analy­sis thinks of power dif­fer­ent­ly—it is not force as pow­er, he said, but the power of lan­guage, of an address that can leave a mark. But the stu­dents kept inter­rupt­ing him, heck­ling that he should stop talk­ing and get out on the streets. By the end of the encoun­ter, Lacan was quite fed-up. They seemed to want a mas­ter despite their protests, he said to them, and if that’s what they want­ed, they would surely get it. He had come to tell them how psy­cho­analy­sis was a rad­i­cal prac­tice—that it might help them—but they did­n’t want to hear any­thing but their own com­plaints.<span></span></p><p>Lacan did­n’t think you could revolt your way out of oppres­sion. Psy­cho­analy­sis cre­ates a change in dis­course which, he believed, was the only way to change some­thing in real­ity or, at the very least, to change our rela­tion­ship<i>to</i>real­i­ty. He told the stu­dents to go write some­thing inter­est­ing, because this would have the most lon­glast­ing effects. Easy to imag­ine, they scoffed at what seemed to them like a con­ser­v­a­tive old man.<span></span></p><p>Lacan was six­ty-­seven in 1968. He would go on to teach and write for another thir­teen years, but he never men­tioned cars pub­licly again.<span></span></p><p>And after the car dis­ap­peared, in his last sem­i­nars, Lacan’s think­ing changed direc­tion. We are left with the conun­drum of the “drive” with­out its vehi­cle, which is per­haps why we find only talk of roads, paths, maps, sur­faces, and topol­o­gy. Lacan’s late work was cer­tainly less enchanted with the mit­i­gat­ing capac­ity of lan­guage and desire on human hos­til­i­ties; nor did he believe any longer in the power of the high­way sys­tem, which, like a good father, could help set things right or give a lit­tle order to the world.</p><p>It is as if, post-1968, Lacan gave up on col­lec­tive ideals because he sus­pected that they all pro­duce the same prob­lem­atic para­noid group effects, from fer­vor for lead­ers and mass hys­te­ria, to racism and other hos­til­i­ties rooted in dif­fer­ence. Fol­low­ing the polit­i­cal dis­as­ters and dis­ap­point­ments of the 1960s and 1970s, many dis­ci­ples of Lacan pre­dicted the appear­ance of more forms of psy­chosis in soci­ety.<span></span></p><p>If early psy­cho­analy­sis showed us any­thing, it was that indi­vid­ual solu­tions could be found, but these took time. We should­n’t be in such a hurry to smash up what exists; it will only open the door to some­thing worse, Lacan warned his audi­ence. Psy­cho­analy­sis, through Lacan’s method­ol­o­gy, would stop tak­ing apart the ide­al-ego in an effort to try to find the nice, benign ego-ide­al; instead, it must attempt to cre­ate some­thing com­pletely new, with­out any guar­an­tee that it could do so. Sub­li­ma­tion we might call this.<span></span></p><p>So can the car sub­vert its fetishis­tic val­ue, its bro­ken promise, its phan­tas­magoric ten­dency toward hos­til­ity and haste? The pos­si­bil­ity was always there, for Lacan. The car as a plea to the oth­er: fol­low me, let’s go! The car as some­thing to dream about, to use to escape one’s fam­i­ly, or any group iden­ti­ty, for what it does to our capac­ity to feel alive. The car as the sign of the life of speech, a sign of what can move us. Through Lacan’s elab­o­rate twen­ty-year love affair with the car, we watch its mean­ing for him vig­or­ously empty itself into life—so that it becomes almost just desire itself. But with its final appear­ance dur­ing the events fol­low­ing May 1968, the car reverts from a dream of lib­er­a­tion and bliss to being a prob­lem­atic ide­al, a will-­to-power whose destruc­tive mis­sion is dif­fi­cult to put the brakes on.<span></span></p><p>I believe this Lacan, and yet I miss the other Lacan and his sense of the car for where, and how, it could trans­port us. Which one is the true sto­ry? The Lacan who detested stop-­lights? Or Lacan the race-­car dri­ver? The Lacan who loved the car? Or a Lacan whose car-ideal was always under threat? A Lacan of the dis­ap­pear­ing car?<span></span></p><p>We often write or think about what we wish for, not nec­es­sar­ily what is—even though what is deter­mi­nes, in ways we often can’t see, what we wish. Per­haps Lacan wanted some­thing other than his own relent­less­ness—­for him­self, his loved ones, his col­leagues, his patients, maybe the whole world. Psy­cho­analy­sis, he said repeat­edly at the end of its life, would prob­a­bly dis­ap­pear from the world. It was too frag­ile for it.</p></section></article></div><!--.col-span-4.sideabar--></div></div>
